# MyNativeAndroidDemo

This is simply the initial result of my reading through 2 online tutorials relating to the addition of [C](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/advanced-android-getting-started-with-the-ndk--mobile-2152) and [C++](http://taylorpeer.com/hello-world-cpp-android-ndk/) code to an Android project.

For compilation instructions please see the [Android Developer page](https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html) and the above tutorials.
